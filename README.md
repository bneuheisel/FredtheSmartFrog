# FredtheSmartFrog
This is the final implementation of the mobile game Fred the Smart Frog.

The premise is that you play as a Frog in this 3D stealth game that has become self aware through successful experiments. You must use your awareness and skill to navigate the map and collect keys to escape the lab and hop your way to freedom.

This was developed entirely in Unity and can be played on any mobile device.
